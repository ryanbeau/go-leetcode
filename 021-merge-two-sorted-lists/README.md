# Problem
[Leetcode - 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

## Takeaway
- There are 2 different approaches.
  1. Iterative.
  2. Recursive.
- Iterative approach uses less resources than recursive but requires more logic.

## Solution
- Choosing the recursive approach reusing the nodes to reduce comprehension complexity.
- If the nodes are equal in value `list1` node should win.
